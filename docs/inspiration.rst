Inspiration
===========
Josiah Carlson deserves some credit.

Long ago I took inspiration from the `Redis object mapper <https://github.com/josiahcarlson/rom>`_ project.
I tried to rewrite his library for my purposes and did a pretty bad job of it.
There were some absurd patch requests that were rightly rejected.

:-)

But I learned a lot in the process.
Hopefully I've grown as a developer since then.
I didn't want a full-fledged ORM but there were some excellent ideas there that provided a jumping off point.
*RedPipe* and *Redis Object Mapper* have different use-cases.
It is worth checking out.
